# SpinBattles Web3 DApp Developer Challenge

This short practical assessment evaluates real DApp development skills for the SpinBattles Web3 DApp Developer role.

---

## Setup

**Requirements:** Node.js 18+, a browser wallet extension (MetaMask recommended)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> The app works out of the box with MetaMask and other browser-injected wallets. No account registration or wallet funds are required.

## Your Goal

Complete and verify the reward claim flow. Most of the wiring is already in place — your job is to verify it works correctly end-to-end, fix one intentional bug, and ensure the UI accurately reflects state at every step.

**Work through this checklist:**

- [ ] Connect a browser wallet and confirm the connection is reflected in the UI
- [ ] Display the full connected wallet address (currently it is truncated)
- [ ] Verify pending reward data is fetched from the backend and displayed correctly
- [ ] Verify the token balance is read from the contract adapter and displayed correctly
- [ ] Complete the reward claim flow: the claim button should submit a transaction, wait for the result, update the backend, and refresh the UI
- [ ] Ensure transaction states are handled correctly at all times: `pending`, `confirmed`, `failed`
- [ ] Confirm the backend reward status updates correctly after a claim
- [ ] Find and fix the one intentional bug in the claim flow — explain what it was and how you fixed it
- [ ] Review the UI for functional clarity — all sections should be visible and accurately reflect state

---

## Deliverables

- Working DApp with the full claim flow verified and complete.
- Bug identified and fixed.
- Brief explanation (inline comments or a short note in this README) covering:
  - Your architecture and integration approach.
  - What the bug was and how you fixed it.

> **Hint:** the bug is in the claim flow. Look at when the backend is notified relative to when the transaction confirmation result is received.

## Assessment Time

This assessment is designed for approximately 1 hour.

---

## Security Note

SpinBattles will never ask for seed phrases, private keys, personal wallet funds, or sensitive wallet credentials.

---

## Notes

- No real funds, tokens, or wallet credentials are needed.
- The contract adapter simulates contract transaction behavior — no deployment required.
- Backend API uses in-memory data and resets on server restart.
- Simulated transactions may sometimes fail. This is intentional and is part of the transaction-state handling assessment.

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Bug-fix reasoning and transaction lifecycle handling | ~35–40% |
| Wallet connection and DApp flow understanding        | ~20%    |
| Backend integration and state refresh                | ~20%    |
| Code clarity and structure                           | ~15%    |
| Functional UI clarity                                | ~5–10%  |
